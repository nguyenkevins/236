                        I love to code, but I never really got to use them in a real life situation. This class allows
                        me to use my coding skills and logic and apply it to website development and visual novel
                        development. Because of my proficient coding skills, I am able to create a creative visual novel
                        that maybe not many people might follow up with. Together, with me and Huy, we will be able to
                        create an awesome story game. As for my other team mates, they are working really well with the
                        story. It seems like they are collaborating with each other very well and that they work as a
                        team. Even when I read their story, it amazes me to see what they accomplish and the potential
                        they bring in the near future. If I were to point one thing I learned from this class, it is to
                        work as a team and communicate as a whole. This class really teaches me the way of teamwork and
                        how it could be a game-changer vs working alone and carrying the team alone. I really appreciate
                        the physical meetings and the video call chat that we put up everyday to make sure we stay on
                        the right track. Overall, our team contains people who are committed to complete the story
                        project with good writing skills, coding skills, and communicating skills.

                        As a story writer, I have been able to get myself familiar with creative writing. I’m
                        responsible to complete the work in the writing team, which includes coming up with ideas and
                        choice-based methods to apply to the story. I’m also responsible for writing the script and
                        revising the writing in general. The project is going on well. About the technical portion such
                        as programming and website set up, I believe Kevin and Huy did a good job. They are working on
                        finding artistic resources and setting up the platform at the moment. In terms of the story
                        writing team, we had some issues to get the ideas started specifically when we all threw a lot
                        of ideas and opinions into the plate without sorting it. But once we got the hang of it as we
                        communicated with each other respectfully, we are on track of selecting the best common idea out
                        of everyone’s opinion. Through this, I learned that collaboration and communication are key to
                        making the operation become smoother as well as solving issues. I usually ask my members what
                        they were thinking in mind towards this one specific task or aspect of the story to know what
                        they are feeling, or if they have any objections about it.

                        For our group project, it is an exciting experience as a story writer to create a story game.
                        The most challenging part of the project was the background of the story since the background
                        should be related to the climate change issue. We researched a lot of story game and film
                        looking for a suitable reference that can be connected to our topic. In the progress of the
                        project, we have faced different issues such as the options of the storyline were complicated
                        after we finished most ideas of the story, and we realized that would increase the pressure and
                        confusion for our game design and our coder Kevin and Huy. Fortunately, we have excellent
                        communication with each other, and we immensely respect others opinion. Therefore, our writing
                        team, Kray, Ryan, and I rearrange our story to be more transparent. In terms of improvement, we
                        should insert more images in our story, and I will search for more images base on our storyline
                        for the rest of the quarter. In short, I learned that creativity and collaboration are the main
                        elements of the project, so I'm so glad that all of my teammates possess these two main
                        elements.

                        My personal experience as a story-writer and doing research for our group has taught me that the
                        story process involves looking for credible sources, sometimes coming up with new ideas and
                        valuing team-work and not having to do all work alone by one self. I valued the meetings very
                        much with Kaki, Kevin, Kray and Huy because I feel that the teamwork we did created a very
                        innovative story that teaches about how humanity’s actions can either positively or negatively
                        impact society and the life-cycle and global climate change are important issues I think can be
                        put into story and game format. I learned that planning and communicating with team is best way
                        to create the best product for the story-game and with this project in class I had to learn to
                        be creative as well. I also feel intrigued by the usage and playing with “story-board” software
                        to create narratives about important issues and learning to appreciate my team. We have a
                        dedicated coder, writers and very thankful for my team for creating such an outstanding concept,
                        and I am proud to be in it.
