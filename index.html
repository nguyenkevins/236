                        The story was written in 2012 by the video game company Telltales Games. This story is an
                        episodic adventure game where the main character’s (the player) actions will determine and
                        influence the story line. The game is available in many different gaming forms such as PC, Xbox,
                        and PS4. The context takes place in a zombie apocalypse in Georgia, and the story revolves
                        around the main character named Lee Everett, a former University professor, who is fighting his
                        way through the zombie outbreak. The story focuses on character development and the implication
                        of survival instinct through certain consequences.
                        In episode 1, Lee luckily escapes from a zombie outbreak on the way to the police station, and
                        he struggles to look for survivors due to the crowded zombies. He met another main character on
                        his way named Clemetine. They reached the farm and met other survivors, but due to several
                        conflicts and deaths, Lee and his groups have to leave the farm to reside at an abandoned hotel.
                        In episode 2, the story starts to emphasize human survival instinct when Lee faced a group of
                        cannibals. At first, Lee thought the cannibal group was friendly and caring, and they would help
                        each other to fight against the zombies, but the cannibals captured Lee’s group member, kill,
                        and eat them. Lee eventually discovered this fact, and he has to eliminate most of the members
                        in the dangerous cannibal group.
                        In episode 3, Lee’s group recruit more people but eventually split up due to internal conflicts.
                        Many intense human shooting and killing were provided. Lee’s group fled on the train to look for
                        better resources, but the city he’s trying to reach carry deadly potential risks.
                        We chose this story, specifically these episodes, because it emphasizes the human life cycles in
                        the zombie outbreak context, which correlates with our life cycle topic. We really like the
                        structure of the story. The chart provided helpful advice for us to create our own story later
                        on. We found out that we can define what would be the important events resulting in branching
                        out rather branch out for every single event. In addition, we learned that we should only branch
                        out in 2 ways, and reconnect it after several events to make sure the story stay connected. In
                        other words, this walking dead chart helps us in organizing and initializing our thinking
                        process. <br>

                        <strong>The Young King</strong><br>
                        Genre: Interactive, Adventure<br>
                        Characters: Young King (the user)<br>
                        Setting: Modern Environment, Factories, (Possibly around the year 1800?)<br>
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/example2.jpg" class=" flow-chart" width="900" height="400">
                        (We got the story inspiration from this game Reigns)<br>
                        <br>

                        <strong>Story Detail</strong><br>
                        The interactive story begins with the user playing as the “Young King”, who rules a country. The
                        story takes place somewhere around the year 1800, when the industrial revolution was a huge
                        thing. The Young King has so much power that the king is able to make people follow the king’s
                        order such as building massive factories or creating many farm places. Based on the King’s order
                        (the user’s decision), the user will follow a path that will eventually lead to a good or bad
                        ending. Each decision will affect how strong the King is, in terms of power. If the King makes
                        many bad decisions, the King will fail the people and will be kicked out. If the King makes many
                        good decision for a certain amount of time, the King will receive a good ending.<br>
                        <br>

                        <img src="images/example1.jpg" class=" flow-chart" width="900" height="400">
                        (there is going to be some sort of player stats like this)<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Technical Detail</strong><br>
                        We want to use Twine(Maybe not Twine) to create a choice-based story game that helps decides
                        what kind of ending the main character gets depending on the path and decisions that the user
                        makes. With the coding as a tool for variable, it could help us create a health-like value that
                        could help measure the effectiveness of the King’s decisions. Our group could also utilize the
                        coding feature of random values in order to give random events to the King.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Climate Change</strong><br>
                        Although climate change isn’t the main theme of our
                        choice-based story, it does play a role in
                        how long the King can last until it will fail to rule the country. If the King fails to keep the
                        environment clean through bad choices, the King will eventually fail to rule. Not only will the
                        King fail to rule, but the user will witness the mess that user created in the story.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Reference</strong><br>
                        This choice-based story is based off the game “Reigns”, where the King must make decisions in
                        order to remain in power the longest. The idea is also based off of many different choice-based
                        games such as The Walking Dead, Corpse Party, and Fallout. Our group might include some factual
                        information in the game so that the audience learn about cause of climate change, based off the
                        article.<br>

                        <strong>PHASE I</strong><br>
                        Kevin, Huy, Ka Ki, Kray, and Ryan met at library 214 before the class. We combined our story
                        ideas and the website. Kevin and Huy created our website, but they need more details of the
                        story on the website. We had discussed that we want to use Twine(Maybe not Twine) to create a
                        choice-based story game that helps decides what kind of ending the main character gets depending
                        on the path and decisions that the user makes. With the coding as a tool for variable, it could
                        help us create a health-like value that could help measure the effectiveness of the King’s
                        decisions. Our group could also utilize the coding feature of random values in order to give
                        random events to the King.

                        <br>

                        <strong>PHASE II</strong><br>
                        Kaki and Kray will work on the story detail. Creating more options for players in our story
                        Ryan will do more research of climate change and combine with the story.
                        Kevin and Huy will design the website with more images and put more details on the website after
                        writing team finished the first draft ideas.<br>
                        <br>

                        <strong>PHASE III</strong><br>
                        Finally, our team as a whole decided to use the Renpy Software to create our game
                        “The Evergreen Kingdom” to create multi-layer (sort of like choose your own) decisions for the
                        story. Above is a desktop sample screenshot of Kaki and Kray’s hard work on the game story and
                        features some of the story sequences and options that were developed. Ryan’s continued research
                        of incorporating climate change for the game story came was developed from the content on the
                        Climate Reality Project websites, which will be list in-game story for interested users to learn
                        more. He pitched some ideas and concepts to Kaki and Kray. The research on such topics as
                        illnesses spread by insects in warmer climate temperature, health conditions of
                        community/laborers affected by industries and hot weather were implemented. Kevin and Huy found
                        various good images of like castles, knights to match with the theme of the game and to be put
                        as the background of the game and start to add more content to the various buttons on the games
                        home page to be implemented in the week after Week 4. The website creation was successful.<br>
                        <br>

                        <strong>PHASE VI</strong><br>
                        After we have decided to use Renpy as our platform and finalized our story plot, the work
                        begins:

                        text and readability issues on the website. However, we receive a lot of positive feedback about
                        the aesthetic and the looks of the website.<br>

                        <br>
                        <strong>Resources:</strong> <br>
                        According to other teams give us feedback, our team uses the game "Reign" as their
                        inspiration for the game and that is stated on their website. Also, we mention a few
                        choice-based plots that helped them decide on this story.
                        We are trying to prevent over pollution and will focus should primarily be connected to over
                        pollution problem. They mention don't see much of climate change included and our team's story
                        is a creation topic, not a real event. I really like the ideas that talk about doing more
                        research on the scientific facts of climate change to help build the choices and provide a good
                        context to them, that could help us a lot of the choices were lacking in this aspect and seemed
                        very generic.<br>

                        <br>
                        <strong>Other suggestions:</strong><br>
                        From the feedback of suggestion, there are several kinds of suggestions to
                        our story and website. First of all, we need to add more connection to climate change with our
                        story. Second, the website page is too succinct and missing the team and the progress of the
                        game. Also, some of the feedback talk about the text of the story that makes the player very
                        confused, so the text can be more details and clarity.<br>

                        <br>
                        <strong>Future Improvement:</strong><br>
                        For future website improvement, our team could carefully revise and elaborate on the plot and
                        details to let the user understands more about our story and themes. We could also emphasize the
                        importance and relevance of climate change to the story. In terms of visuality and readability.
                        We could change the text font and style to make it stand out and be more readable. In addition,
                        background change would increase readability as well.<br>

                        <br>
                        For climate change, we will add more information about climate change that can make
                        their story more relative to this final project's original topic. And adding data can help the
                        statement stronger and using more historical data to support our theme. We will provide related
                        picture resources with the description I think could help those readers can understand the story
                        clearly, we will include some more topics around the environment and how factories contribute to
                        global warming or include some choice where it talks about the effects to climate pending on
                        what the user chooses. For the most important thing, we will add a decision at least that.<br>
                        focuses on the environmental effects.<br>

                        <br>
                        For the rest of the time, we will do more research about climate change to make more connection
                        with our story. Also, we have been finished our update of team progress, and we will put that
                        into our website as soon as possible. For the text of the story on the website, we will try to
                        make the text simple and clean to avoid player confusion.
