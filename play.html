                        <strong>About The Game:</strong> <br>
                        <div class="dropdown-text-play">The Evergreen Kingdom is an interactive story that revolves
                            around the evironment as being the story's main theme.
                            You play as the rightful king who is tasked with making decisions that can either positvely
                            or negatively
                            affect the outcome of the game. The ideal outcome would be keeping your kingdom as healthy
                            as possible in terms of
                            clean enviroment and healthy people. There is also a stats system that has four categories:
                            LP (loyalty points), EP(enviroment points), DP(dilopmatic points),
                            RP(resources points), and each carries its own importance in the story-line. You are to make
                            the right choices to keep
                            these points above the minimum or your kingdom will fail.</div>

                            <span> <br> At the start of the game, you will be introduced to the stats system that has
                                detailed explanations about what each stat category means.

                            <span> <br>There are two choices at every turn of the story and you are to make the most
                                ideal choice for your kingdom. Keep in mind that you have to look after
                                your stats points to avoid any of them going below the minimum threshold</span>
