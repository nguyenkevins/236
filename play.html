                        <strong>About The Game:</strong> <br>
                        <div class="dropdown-text-play">The Evergreen Kingdom is an interactive story that revolves
                            around the evironment as being the story's main theme.
                            You play as the rightful king who is tasked with making decisions that can either positvely
                            or negatively
                            affect the outcome of the game. The ideal outcome would be keeping your kingdom as healthy
                            as possible in terms of
                            clean enviroment and healthy people. There is also a stats system that has four categories:
                            LP (loyalty points), EP(enviroment points), DP(dilopmatic points),
                            RP(resources points), and each carries its own importance in the story-line. You are to make
                            the right choices to keep
                            these points above the minimum or your kingdom will fail.<br>

                            <br>
                            The young king’s mission is to control his kingdom after his father’s death due to the
                            disease
                            caused by climate change. There will be climate change problems arise at the beginning of
                            the
                            game. If the player chooses the environment-friendly route, they will possibly end up with a
                            good ending where the kingdom achieves peace and clean environment. If the player chooses
                            the
                            opposite route, they will for sure end up with a bad ending such as watching the kingdom
                            conquered or the king being executed. Additionally, we included special features to make
                            this
                            game more interacting which are status bars. Based on each decision the player makes, the
                            status
                            of loyalty points, environmental points, diplomatic points, and resources points will
                            change. In
                            general, the player wants to keep the loyalty points and resources points decent to order
                            the
                            people in the kingdom to perform a certain action such as fighting without having too much
                            risk.
                            If these two stats are low, the chances of losing fights and the kingdom being disordered
                            are
                            high. The player wants to maintain diplomatic points in order to establish peace and avoid
                            fights with other kingdoms. Environmental point is crucial because it determines the success
                            of
                            the king ruling the kingdom overall. Having high environmental points would guarantee a good
                            ending for the king.<br>

                            <br>
                            The game focuses on situational decision making based on the stats the player currently
                            have.
                            The climate change plays a big role on whether the king succeeds or fails to govern his
                            kingdom.
                            We included information about vector-borne disease that is caused by climate change, which
                            kills
                            the young king’s father. We wanted to let the player know that climate change will be one of
                            the
                            main themes in this game. We achieved this more when we put a situation that involves
                            climate
                            change such as whether or not to pause the factories. The key of the game lies in here. If
                            the
                            player chooses to not pause the factories, the commoners’ health conditions will be affected
                            badly due to the dirty air and rising temperature, and that effect will carry on until the
                            end
                            of the game. We didn’t meet our intent the way we want it to be. If we included more
                            situations
                            involving climate change, the climate change theme and its bond to the game will be more
                            clear
                            to the player.<br>
